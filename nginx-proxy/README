Nginx proxy example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example contains a basic configuration for setting up Nginx as a
reverse proxy.

Please go to the folder of any other example that enables the webserver
(webui/rest), and run it, via

# make clean all start

Afterwards, from this folder, you can run

# make nginx

You should now be able to open your browser at "http://localhost:8090",
and interact with the running example, although traffic will be routed
via the nginx proxy.
