A Python ConfD to ConfD NETCONF synchronizer application
=======================================================

Build a ConfD Docker container based on Debian 10 Linux Docker image
and run the examples.confd/linuxcfg ConfD example.

- IETF standard YANG models are used to edit interface, routing, and 
  system configuration. 
- See examples.confd/linuxcfg/README for details.
- A mk_linuxcfg_init script was added to get the initial config from 
  the Debian 10 Linux distribution at ConfD startup. 

Prerequisites
-------------

confd-7.x.linux.x86_64.installer.bin
confd-7.x.examples.tar.gz
confd-7.x.libconfd.tar.gz
Docker installed

Steps
-----

1. Drop the confd-7.x* installation packages into this directory.
2. Run the setup.sh script.
3. Examine the setup.sh -> Dockerfile -> run.sh -> mk_linuxcfg_init 
   files in that order.
