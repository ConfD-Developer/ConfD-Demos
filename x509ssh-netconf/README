NETCONF over SSH with X.509 Certificates for Mutual Authentication
==================================================================

RFC 6187 describe using X.509 certificates for Secure Shell authentication
that can be used to mutually authenticate the NETCONF client and server.

While ConfD natively support the well established RFC 6242 with a built in SSH
server, ConfD is delivered with a program called netconf-subsys which is an
OpenSSH subsystem program that functions as a relay between the OpenSSH daemon
and the ConfD NETCONF server. The same mechanism can be used with PKIX-SSH, a
fork of OpenSSH that add for example X.509 certificate support according to
RFC 6187.

To illustrate, this demo implements a simple NETCONF SSH server example using
X.509 mutual authentication according to RFC 6187.

About the example:
o The example use Roumen Petrov's PKIX-SSH implementation,
  https://gitlab.com/secsh/pkixssh, to setup the an X.509 certificate capable
  SSH server with ConfD's NETCONF server as a subsystem.
o We modify the $CONFD_DIR/examples.confd/intro/1-2-3-start-query-model for
  NETCONF over PKIX-SSH instead of over the ConfD built-in SSH server.
