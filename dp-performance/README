A Generic Data Provider Setup Targeting Optimal Wall-Clock Time Performance
===========================================================================

Build a ConfD Docker container based on a Debian 10 Docker image and
run a generic ConfD Data Provider (DP API) example. The demo also show the
difference in performance when reading the operatonal YANG "config false" data
from various NETCONF, RESTCONF, and MAAPI clients. In addition, the DP
application use the ConfD CDB operational data store to provide data from by
efficiently reading the requeted data from the CDB operational data store using
the CDB API.

- For optimal performance for the general use case we only implement the
  following four Data Provider application callbacks:
  - num_instances()
  - get_object()
  - find_next()
  - find_next_object()
  - See app/src/cdboper_dp.c for the implementation of the above
- The example assume that your root node is a container or a list. I.e. not a
  leaf. We can then set the CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_BULK_GET_CONTAINER flag using
  confd_set_daemon_flags() and skp implementing the get_elem() data provider
  callback. To have a container or list at the YANG root and not put any leafs
  there is the recommened YANG best practices.

              YANG root
                  |
 Top level YANG Container or List node
                  |
      ---------------------...-----
     |            |                |
 YANG Node x   YANG Node y ... YANG Node z

- The Data Provider application read the data it provides from the CDB
  operational data store.

           -> Application -

- To achieve the above, we create a copy of the original YANG models, add
  "-state" to their YANG module name, namespace and prefix, and make all data in
  them "config false".
- The implementation of the data provider callbacks in the cdboper_dp.c data
  provider application use the schema generated from the YANG models and the
  following CDB API calls to provide the requested data:
  - num_instances() DP callback:
    - cdb_num_instances()
  - get_object() DP callback:
    - cdb_index()
    - cdb_get_values()
  - find_next() DP callback:
    - cdb_index()
    - cdb_next_index()
    - cdb_get_values()
  - find_next_object() DP callback:
    - cdb_index()
    - cdb_next_index()
    - cdb_num_instances()
    - cdb_get_values()
- The north bound NETCONF / RESTCONF / MAAPI interface clients requesting data:
    - NETCONF <get-data>, an RFC 8526 NETCONF NMDA extension that allow us to
      use a config-filter to get "config false" data only.
    - NETCONF <get>, legacy way before <get-data> was available.
    - RESTCONF GET in JSON format.
    - maapi_save_config() of oper data in XML format.
    - maapi_save_config() of oper data in JSON format.
    - maapi_iterate() to get the oper data in ConfD keypath + value format to
      for example transform it into any format that maapi_save_config() does not
      support.
    - maapi_get_objects() of list items to get the list content in ConfD value
      array format. Works best for non-nested lists.
    - See run.sh and maapi_iter.c + maapi_save.c for details.
- The wall clock time take is measured for each of the above north bound clients
  for a configurable size of the data read.
- Two test types are used:
  1. Data in the list of routes (nested list) only.
  2. All data
- Again, the purpose of the example is to show an example implementation of a
  high performance data provider, but the example also give some guidance in how
  to use the CDB API, MAAPI and other northbound clients.

Prerequisites
-------------

confd-7.x.linux.x86_64.installer.bin
confd-7.x.libconfd.tar.gz
Docker installed

Steps
-----
1. Drop the confd-7.x* installation packages into the directory of this README.
2. Run the setup.sh script.
2b. Wait for the comma separated value (CSV) style test result output.
2c. Run
   $ docker exec -it oper-data bash
   from the command line to for example access and read logs etc.
3. Examine the setup.sh -> Dockerfile -> app/run.sh -> app/maapi*.c and
   app/src/cdboper_dp.c files in that order.
4. The app/run.sh script by default define the number of entries read using the
   "START_NUM" "STEP_NUM" and "STOP_NUM" variables. You may change those numbers
   to better represent your system setup.
5. You can also switch out the YANG models for your own setup. Please report if
   issues occur with your YANG model setup. If you want to use the cdbgen.py
   script to generate the operational data to provide from you need to modify
   that Python script too.
