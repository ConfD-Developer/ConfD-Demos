An image for creating a ConfD target package
============================================

Summary
-------

The result of running this container is a tar-ball with all files
required for a minimal target installation including support for all
northbound interfaces, as described in section 31.3 Installing ConfD
on a target system from the ConfD User Guide.  Note that for older
ConfD releases target installation is described in section 29.3 in the
UG.  Also note that the exact list files required for target
installation sometimes change between releases and might need
updating.  This package includes target package file lists for ConfD
6.7.5, ConfD 7.1, ConfD 7.2.0.1.

Prerequisites
-------------

o The files included in this package.  o ConfD Linux installer located
in a sub directory named resources/confd/<confd version>.  Examples
and documentation tar-ball are not needed since they aren't used in
the target installation.

Steps
-----

1. Create the image for the specified ConfD version (default ConfD
   7.2.0.1, the latest version at time of writing).  Pass the flag
   --build-arg ver=<confd version> to build for another ConfD version.

$ docker build --tag target-package-builder:v7.2.0.1 [--build-arg ver=<other-confd-version>] .

2. Generate confd target package (send the build result to stdout)

$ docker run --rm --env STDOUT=1 --env VER=7.2.0.1 target-package-builder:v7.2.0.1 > confd-target.tgz

3. It's also possible to keep the container around and copy the
   resulting tar-ball using the docker cp command from the container
   to the host.  The environment variable STDOUT=1 should not be set
   in this case:

$ docker run --name target-builder target-package-builder:v7.2.0.1
$ docker cp target-builder:/confd-target.tgz .
$ docker rm target-builder
