A minimal ConfD image
=====================

Build a ConfD docker containr based on Alpine Linux.

Prerequisites
-------------

A tar-ball containing the files for a minimal ConfD target
installation as described in section 31.3 Installing ConfD
on a target system from the ConfD User Guide.  Note that for older
ConfD releases target installation is described in section 29.3 in the
UG.  Also note that the exact list files required for target
installation sometimes change between releases, this package includes
target package file lists for ConfD 6.7.5, ConfD 7.1 and ConfD 7.2.0.1.

Dockerfile and instructions for creating the target installation
tar-ball can be found in the ../target-package-builder directory.

Steps
-----
1. Drop the target installation package into the resources directory.
2. Create the ConfD image

$ docker build --tag confd:v<version> .

3. Run the docker image and expose the NETCONF, CLI and internal IPC ports.

$ docker run -it --rm -p 2022:2022 -p 4565:4565 --init confd:v<version>

confd[7]: - Loading file /confd/etc/confd/confd.ccl
confd[7]: - Starting to listen for Internal IPC on 0.0.0.0:4565

4. Test the NETCONF interface

$ netconf-console --hello
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
  <capabilities>
    <capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.0</capability>
    <capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.1</capability>
    <capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:writable-running:1.0</capability>

    ...

    <capability>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-types?module=ietf-yang-types&amp;revision=2013-07-15</capability>
    <capability>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0?module=ietf-netconf&amp;revision=2011-06-01</capability>
    <capability>urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-with-defaults?module=ietf-netconf-with-defaults&amp;revision=2011-06-01</capability>
  </capabilities>
  <session-id>12</session-id>
</hello>
