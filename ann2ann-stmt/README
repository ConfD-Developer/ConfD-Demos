Convert tailf:annotate Statements to tailf:annotate-(module|statement)
======================================================================

tailf:annotate and tailf-annotate-module in combination with tailf:annotate-
statement is often used to annotate an existing module or submodule statement
with a 'tailf' statement. This is useful in order to add tailf statements to
a module without touching the module source, which also means that when the 
YANG models are requested using NETCONF <get-schema> the annotations of tailf
extensions that may not be understood by the NETCONF client, unless the 
client is for example NSO, will not be included in the YANG model. The 
annotation statements can then be placed in a separate annotation module, and
then passed to 'confdc' (or 'pyang' or 'yanger') when the original module is
compiled.

tailf:annotate is used to annotate the resulting schema from the compiled
YANG model while tailf:annotate-(module|statement) is used to annotate the
original YANG model.

Sometimes a ConfD project start with creating annotations using
tailf:annotate, while later realizing how powerful it is to annotate on a
YANG model directly using tailf:annotate-(module|statement).

For example, groupings are merged with the YANG models when compiling the
schema from the original YANG models, so tailf:annotate cannot annotate
groupings that are used by various parts of the same or other YANG models.
tailf:annotate-(module|statement) annotate the YANG models and can thus
annotate groupings with one time instead of in all the places where the
grouping is used.

Other reasons to use tailf:annotate-(module|statement) include using 
annotation modules with the NSO ncsc --compile-bundle feature that does 
transformations on the YANG models before compiling the final schema. 
NSO compile-bundle therefore does not support tailf:annotation, only 
tailf:annotate-(module|statement) is supported. NSO compile-bundle generate
YANG modules and needs to adjust the path to match the new destination. 
Using annotations from tailf:annotate that was intended for use with another 
schema would therefore be error prone as ncsc would have to in many cases 
guess what the intention of the tailf:annotate was for the schema that the
compile-bundle feature arrived at.

Converting already implemented tailf:annotate annotation modules to the
more powerful tailf:annotate-(module|statement) can be a time consuming
task if done manually. This demo attempts to provide a starting point
for doing basic conversion using a Python script.

About the demo:
o The demo converts YANG models to YIN XML using the pyang Python tool.
o The XML format is supported by many powerful tools that can aid in the
  modification of the YANG modules (now in YIN format).
o In this demo we use the powerful Python Beautiful Soup Python (bs4)
  library that in turn uses the lxml library for processing XML.
o After tailf:annotation XML nodes have been converted to 
  tailf:annotate-(module|statement) variants, pyang is used to convert
  the YIN modules back to YANG modules.
o The YANG model used for this demo convert perfectly. However, if there
  are more than one candidate node path remaining after matching
  tailf:annotate path against nodes, the two or more conflicting node
  trees will be wrapped with a <conflict number="1 of x">...</conflict>
  tag. The winning candidate can then be selected manually, and the node
  tree that is not what was intended to be used by the tailf:annotate
  path can be discarded. Any corner cases for which handing has not yet
  been implemented will be shown as a <skipped target="/path/to/node"/>
  Note that pyang will complain if you try to convert a YIN file that 
  contain <conflict> or <skipped> tags to YANG.

If there are issues with converting a YANG annotation, the path of the
tailf:annotation statement can be tricky to follow if it traverses 
augments and groupings. One way to get a better overview of a YANG model
is to, for example, use the pyang tool to print a YANG tree diagram:

$ python3 /usr/local/bin/pyang -f tree -p yin -p $CONFD_DIR/src/confd/yang \
--tree-print-groupings --tree-no-expand-uses yin/mtest.yin
module: mtest
  +--rw mtest-container
     +--rw a-number?   int64
     +--rw b-number?   int64
     +--rw c-number?   string
     +--rw group* [id]
        +--rw id           string
        +--rw (security-model)?
           +--:(v1)
           |  +--rw v1
           +--:(v2c)
           |  +--rw v2c
           +--:(v3)
              +--rw v3
                 +--rw security-level-list* [security-level]
                 |  +--rw security-level            enumeration
                 |  +---u config-access-grouping
                 +--rw context?               string
                 +--rw match?                 enumeration
                 +--rw read?                  string
                 +--rw write?                 string
                 +--rw notify?                string
                 +--rw access?                union

  grouping config-access-grouping
    +-- access-config
       +-- ipv6-acl?         string
       +-- (access-option)?
          +--:(acl-name)
          |  +-- acl-name?   string
          +--:(ipv6)
             +-- ipv6?       string

The Python script print the converted tailf-annotate-module/statement based
result in YIN "raw" XML format. If you for example for debug purposes want to 
print the YIN XML in "pretty" format you can use, for example, xmllint or
pyang to do so:

$ python3 /usr/local/bin/pyang -f yin -p yin -p $CONFD_DIR/src/confd/yang \
yin/mtest-ann.yinmod
...
